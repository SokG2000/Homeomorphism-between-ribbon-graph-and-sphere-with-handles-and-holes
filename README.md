# Homeomorphism-between-ribbon-graph-and-sphere-with-handles-and-holes
To test the program, you can use any online compiler, for example http://cpp.sh.

The program for given ribbon graph G (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_graph) without twisted ribbons finds numbers g and h suchthat G is homemomorphic to the sphere with g handles and h holes.

The program takes as input the following discription of ribbon graph: the number of vertexes, the number of ribbons, for each vertex the degree of the vertex and the ribbons incident to this vertex in given oriented cyclic order. The program outputs the numbers g and h.  

The complexity of the algorithm is O(n + m), where n is number of vertexes and m is number of ribbons in G.

This program was prepared in frame of the course `Discrete structures and lgorithms in topology' in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Website of the course: https://www.mccme.ru/circles/oim/home/combtop13.htm.
